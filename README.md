I found this article interesting because it explains how software quality is not just about writing correct code, but about long-term maintainability and engineering discipline. It shows how technical debt builds up quietly when teams move fast without structure.

As a computer science student building AI and software tools, I’ve noticed that prototypes are easy to build, but clean and maintainable systems are much harder. The article connects strongly with why version control, collaboration workflows, and disciplined engineering practices matter in real projects.
